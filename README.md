# Space Bottle
A game written in **Python** using **pygame** module. My personal project and a way for me to learn new programming language.

The game has two game modes. 

- **Story mode:** Not implemented yet
- **Endless mode:** The goal of endless mode is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding hostile aliens.
