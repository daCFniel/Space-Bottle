# Space Bottle
A game written in **Python** using **pygame** module. My personal project and a way for me to learn new programming language.

The game has two game modes. 

- **Story mode:** Not implemented yet.
- **Endless mode:** The goal of endless mode is to stay alive as long as possible by avoiding hostile aliens.


# About Space Bottle 

Can you meet the challenge and become the best spacecraft pilot in the galaxy?

If you like space, shooting and arcade games, then this is the game for you.

You start out as the captain of a space ship and must survive as long as possible in a deadly space where almost everything that moves wants to destroy you... 

The game includes skin shop and rank system.
